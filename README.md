# Pneumonia-Detection
Early detection of pneumonia is a bit difficult as symptoms are similar to cold or flu. Pneumonia is an infection inflaming the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with purulent material or fluid, causing difficulty in breathing, cough, chills, and fever. A deep productive cough from the lungs is a symptom of Pneumonia. The lungs react to emotions of grief, fear, unhappiness, feeling unloved, the inability to handle all that is coming at once, etc. The certain risk factors that are associated with pneumonia are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, diabetes, cystic fibrosis, heart failure, etc. People suffering from pneumonia experience a weak immune system, and feel chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, etc.  When compared to previous researches on the topic we decided to use DenseNet model that has been compared to  various  other transfer models.  This research presents a method to predict Pneumonia using transfer learning and improves efficiency and reliability. The proposed method helps doctors to diagnose Pneumonia.
